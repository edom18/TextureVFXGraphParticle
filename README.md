# This project demonstrates two texture particle effects.



This project uses VFX graph to make particle effects with a texture.

First one is that texture is affected from right side to left side. It's used a turbulence effect.

Second one is that the texture is affected by a perlin noise. If you start that time then the texture will dissolve depending on the noise.
